2007-08-30  gga  <ggarra@advancedsl.com.ar>

	* mrClasses/mrFilters.h: Made the filters use a table and classes.
	* mrClasses/mrRayDifferentials.h: Added ray differentials code.

2006-12-11  gga  <ggarra@advancedsl.com.ar>

	* LPGL: Removed mrTiff from distribution, to make mrClasses
	a true BSD distribution.
	
2006-12-09  gga  <ggarra@advancedsl.com.ar>

	* mrClasses/fvec.h: Added fvec.h for platforms that do not supply
	such a class (most GNU platforms)

2006-12-07  gga  <ggarra@advancedsl.com.ar>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Created CMakeLists.txt for porting to other 
	platforms.
	* ChangeLog: Switched to using ChangeLog.


v0.1.8	gga  <ggarra@advancedsl.com.ar>

	 * Several typos removed.
	 * Made code work on linux.
	 * Fixed a problem with mi_query() of number of derivatives, bumps and
	   textures.
	 * Fixed a bug in parallax_bump(), as it was not calculating offsets
           properly.
	 * Fixed two ugly bugs in from/toTangent code.  I was creating 
	   the matrix in row order, instead of column order and from/to
	   was actually reversed.

	 New features
	 ------------
	
	 * Added mrRoots.h.  Added support for quadratic, cubic, quartic
	   root finders.
	 * Vectors/Points/Normals are now printed without a comma for
           each element.  This makes it easier to cut/paste those values into
           maya's requesters to verify things.


v0.1.7 - And old bug fix release I forgot to upload....

	 Bug fixes:
         ----------

	 - gg_fakefur was buggy and creating nan values, due to TWO divisions
	   by 0 in fakefurOpacity near glancing angles (probably a bug in
	   the original prman code, but prman's RSL hides bugs of dividing 
	   by 0).
	   Also shader was slower due to being operated in shadow calls, 
	   which was unneeded (now it is faster).
	   And fakefur was not dealing with area lights properly.
	   Thanks go to pixero for the demo scene.

	 - gg_velvet was incorrectly dealing with area lights.

	 - gg_skin could also potentially lead to NAN values in some very, 
	   very, very rare cases.  Fixed.
	   gg_skin was also incorrectly dealing with multiple lights.

	 - Miguel's shaders (gg_velvet, gg_fakefur, gg_orennayar, gg_skin) 
	   were not taking global illumination into account.  Fixed.

	 - Fixed typo in dPdu and dPdv macros in mrRman_macros.h

	 - Improved comparison speed of matrices.

	 - Pixie's tiff reading code was offseting maps one pixel compared
	   to maya.  Fixed.

	 Minor improvements:
	 -------------------

	 - Updated EXR output shader for mray3.4
	 - Upgraded tiff code to support 16-bit tiffs properly
	   (I'll probably need to rewrite this code, as Pixie's code, albeit
	   good is also a tad inefficient overall for reading tiffs)
	 - gg_ctiff and gg_tiff now support multiple uvsets.


v0.1.6 - Bug fixes:
         ----------
	 Fixed one of the fromTangent() functions.

	 Fixed from/toScreen() and equivalent matrix creation functions.
	 (well, at least for perspective projection and without camera
	  offsets)

	 Fixed 2 bugs in mrTiff.cpp handling of tiff mipmaps (one minor,
	 the other serious -crash).  To generate the mipmaps, you can use
	 either Pixie or Aqsis (Prman, RDC, Air probably also work, but have
	 not tested them).

	 Fixed fastmath's ceil() function (well, not quite.  It can still
	 fail here and there.  Need to do some hex coding here) 

	 gg_tiff/gg_ctiff should now work fine under IPR.

	 Fixed a possible crash in BumpUV function.

	 What's new:
	 -----------
	 Consolidated project for maya5/6 development locations.

	 Stripped all maya dependent libraries which were really not
	 used in compilation so that it is easier for users of XSI, 
	 3dMax, or others.

	 Added support for Aqsis tiff mipmaps in mrTiff.

	 Added mipmap histogram to mrTiff final stats.

	 Improved speed a tad of tiff texture reading code in some cases.

	 Added mipmap histogram stats for tiff reading thru mrTiff.

	 Added Miguel Garcao's shaders (gg_orennayar, gg_velvet,
	 gg_noises, gg_skin, gg_fakefur).  Thanks, Miguel.

	 Added gg_spherical lens shader to generate renders around in a 
	 sphere (requires scanline to be turned off, but it seems maya2mr
	 is buggy in this aspect, as scanline is always on?)
	 
	 Added gg_shaderstate_peek shader to peek into shaderstate message
	 passing when you don't control source code to shaders.

	 Created mrRefractions.h and added Daniel Rind's blurred refraction
	 code.  Still needs some more thought on how to expose this easily.

	 Created mrShadows.h and consolidated shadow api.
	 
v0.1.5 - Bug fixes.
         Added mrShading.h, fixed some macros in mrRman_macros.h,
	 fixed typo in some color constructors, added new sampler functions,
	 fixed ugly crash in ambient/reflection occlusion when using blockers,
	 fixed perlin to calculate gradient properly in all dimensions.

	 Developed some hair shaders (for maya) as a way of testing the
	 classes, but I am currently not disting them yet.  I fear disting
	 this code will effect the sales of several products, so I am somewhat
	 reluctant to do it.

	 Added support for SSE in matrix class, thru optional compile switch.
	 This makes matrix class twice as fast if not more for many 
	 operations (inversion, sums, multiplications, etc)

	 Upgraded gg_exr to properly support OpenEXR1.2.1.

	 The OpenEXR and libtiff I use are now disted with mrClasses
	 (mrClasses_v*.zip), but a smaller distribution is available
	 (mrClasses_v*_alone.zip), too.

v0.1.2 - Bug fixes.  Added gg_exr, output shader for OpenEXR.
v0.1   - first version uploaded to sourceforge.net
