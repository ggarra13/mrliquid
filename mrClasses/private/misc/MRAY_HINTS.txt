MAP FILES
---------

Generate .map files with tiling (imf_copy -r) and then force mental ray to 
agressively cache them with setting  "MI_1TC_LIMIT=1" in your environment.  
Personally I think using .map files without these settings is a pointless 
waste of time because because you're not saving yourself any address space.
