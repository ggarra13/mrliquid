This is a list of known bugs and issues.


- DsuDtv does not quite work as expected.  
It returns something that is like DsuDtv but slightly slanted.  
Not sure why.  Also the barycentric coordinates are not 100% continuous.
This function should be considered experimental for the time being.

- Class have a lot of internal documentation, but not all is
  shown if Doxygen is run on it, as the format followed is not 100%
  compatible.

- Blinn bump mapping is missing the bump normalization for polygons.
  (ADDED BUT NOT YET TESTED -- this can sometimes be a pain to get right)

- fastmath<double>::invsqrt will only work in float precision.

- area(state,P) probably is not possible in mray without point caching.
  Should likely be removed?

- textureinfo(), match(), texture(), shadow() still not properly
  implemented in prman.  Not sure if I should implement some of them,
  as there are other more correct ways of doing it.  I mean, textureinfo
  would be just a short form for mi_query() for example.
  Same with texture(), as the example is given in gg_tiff.cpp.  Shading
  networks make needing this much, much less than in renderman.
  shadow() should probably be added, thou.
  match() never used it, neither in prman nor in mray.  Plus there are
  plenty of good regex libraries out there.  No need to bloat mrClasses
  with that.
