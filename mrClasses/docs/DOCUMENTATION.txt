These set of classes simplifies usage of the mental ray API, by using
C++ wrappers.
It uses some advanced but now well supported C++ features in modern 
compilers (VC7.1, gcc3+, Intel).  These classes will likely not work
properly or at all on machines with not so great compilers (SGI, etc).

Classes have currently been tested on VC 7.1 and VC6 with the Intel 
compiler.

WHAT'S INCLUDED
---------------

mrClasses,  a group of demo shaders,the corresponding .mi files for the
demo shaders, AEtemplates for some shaders to use in maya.

WHAT YOU MAY NEED
-----------------
If you want to build all of the shaders and mrClasses, you will need
to download:

* Bash
Standard in any linux or osx distribution.
For Windows, install cygwin ( www.cygwin.com ) or MSYS ( www.mingw.org )

* CMake
www.cmake.org
This is a kickass replacement for Makefiles/GNU's autoconf.

* OpenEXR
ILM's OpenEXR library.
www.openexr.org

You can still build the library and shaders without OpenEXR, but some
stuff (mainly gg_exr_standalone.cpp) will not work.


HISTORY
-------

mrClasses was written in some spare time in about 3-4 months, while being 
bored in Argentina.  But its roots date way back.

Ever since my working at DD, I started learning and tinkering with C++.
One of the original things I experimented with back then, was to wrap the 
C apis of Softimage SAAPHIRE and mental ray into C++ code 
(Back then, this just meant overloading operators and it was pretty damn
horrible and inefficient code, as my code usually looks when I am testing 
new ideas).
At a following smaller and now defunct company, a second attempt at mrClasses
 began timidly, as a more elaborate rewrite, expanding on that previous 
experience.  Use of templates was minimum or non-existant due to the state 
of compilers back then, but much groundwork was placed to completely 
replace the miColor and similar structs by proper C++ classes.  
Sadly, the company more or less closed before much testing had been done
with it.  The code would later provide useful at other places.
This third rewrite was my idea to push template use more (as described by 
blinn), while at the same time I added new ideas that came my way.
I also wanted to be able to take advantage of any open source code available,
and start setting up a framework so that if there was enough interest, it 
would be relatively easy to  add/remove code that would access 
graphic cards, too.


This new version has not yet been really battle tested under ANY real 
production and as such, ugly bugs are bound to still be lurking around.  
Also, there's still a big list of things to add or change (see TODO).


WHY RELEASE IT?
---------------
A bunch of reasons, I guess.  On one hand, our industry is maturing, so most 
of the stuff contained herein is not such a technological advantage anymore.
I also happen to change companies every now and then and find myself 
re-writing similar code time and again.  And hell, I hate writing code.
Hopefully providing an open source repository will help me (and others) do
it faster, instead of starting from scratch.  And perhaps, someone will
come around and do a much better job than me so I can dedicate myself to just
doing artistic stuff :)
I also like helping out smart kids with their problems, as they usually
reward you by creating something cool and teaching you something else in
return.
Finally, I thought it was fitting and overdue that someone finally sat down
and shared some code the way the renderman community does.  


COMPILING
---------

* ALL Platforms

Open a bash window, then run:

> cd Directory/of/mrClasses  # directory where mrClasses is located
> ./mk




A BASIC INTRODUCTION
--------------------

All the C++ wrappers are all under the namespace "mr", albeit some other
namespaces within mr are also used.
Thus, the usual usage of mrClasses to start your shader like:

#include "mrGenerics.h"
using namespace mr;

Note that shader.h, math.h, etc. are already automatically included.
The library is also fully compatible with the STL, but you have to be
careful when using vectors as both mr::vector and std::vector mean quite
different things.

Within mrClasses, you will find equivalent classes for most mi??? structs.
Thus, for miVector, there is a mr::vector, mr::point, and mr::normal.
For miColor, there's mr::color.
For miMatrix, there's mr::matrix.

All these classes overload all the standard operators to allow easy
operations and comparisons.  

Vectors / Points / Normals
--------------------------

Unlike mray, there exist classes identifying each type for easier
manipulation.  All of them derive from miVector, so they are backwards
compatible with it.

In vectors and normals, Overloading of ^ and % is used for cross product 
and dot product where appropiate (to make it similar to renderman, and
not to respect operator precendence, which in my experience, is not so
much an issue - Use parenthesis to desambiguate).
Ex:    miScalar dot_nl = N % L
       normal N = dPdu ^ dPds

Mnemonics: % finds where a point is in front/behind a plane.
           ^ is two perpendicular vectors at an angle.

Classes support to/fromSPACE for transformations and transform().
Ex:    P.toNDC(state);
       N.toObject(state);

Swizzle operators are provided for assignment and reading.
Ex:    Nflip = N.zyx();
       Nflip.zyx( N );

Assignment and reading of components is possible thru indicess, too.
Ex:    miScalar x = P[0];
       P[i] *= 2;

Most concatenated operations are transformed (thru the magic of templates)
into single channel operations.
Ex:    point Psum, P0, P1, P2;
       Psum = P0 + P1 * P2;
With a good compiler should become:
       point Psum, P0, P1, P2;
       Psum.x = P0.x + P1.x * P2.x;
       Psum.y = P0.y + P1.y * P2.y;
       Psum.z = P0.z + P1.z * P2.z;
unlike your typical vector class.
Note that some compilers limit the amount of nested templates for evaluation
so check that you set your settings for the maximum template recursion.
For windows, this is done in mrWin32.h thru a couple of pragmas.


Objects are inited to 0 by default, but can be left without initing.
Ex:	point P0;   // P0 = [0,0,0]
	point P0( kNoInit );   // P0 =[?,?,?] like miVector declaration.
                               // x,y,z contain random numbers, not 0.

For more information, consult the .h files.


Color
-----

Very similar features to vectors.
Color operations work similar to prman, in that the alpha channel is NOT
modified in any operations.  Not even in assignments.
For assigning colors with alpha channel, the operator |= can be used.
Thus...
	color a,c;
	c  = a;  // c.r = a.r, c.g = a.g, c.b = a.b, c.a = ?
	c |= a;  // c.r = a.r, c.g = a.g, c.b = a.b, c.a = a.a

A good mnemonic for this is to remember how colors are printed with
mr_info(), where the alpha is separated by |:

	( 1.0, 0.4, 0.2 | 1.0 )

You can of course also manipulate the alpha manually, with:
    c.a = 1.0f;
or 
    c[3] = 1.0f;


Matrix
------
A tad more expensive than miMatrix, as it is not derived from it.

Passing miMatrix pointers to functions is achieved by using:
	matrix r,m1,m2;
	mi_matrix_prod(&r,&m1,&m2);

which tends to make more sense than mray's:
      miMatrix r,m1,m2;
      mi_matrix_prod(r,m1,m2);

Most features of vectors are available (component access, constructor
without initialization, etc).
vectors, points and normals can be post-multiplied by a matrix, by doing:
	 matrix m; point P;
	 P *= m;
or by the inverse as prman:
	 P /= m;
normals are automatically multiplied by the transpose of the matrix.

The matrix class has several routines to take advantage of SSE optimizations
(for AthlonXP,64 and Pentium3 or later processors).  These are turned on
by default, using the MR_SSE flag and the windows' /G6 and /arch:SSE flags. 


Streams
-------

Don't you hate printing and debugging things with mi_info and similar?
I do.  As such, some stream classes and macros allow using C++ stream 
syntax for easier debugging.

Thus, instead of doing the cumbersome:
    miColor test;
    mi_info("%f %f %f %f", test.r, test.g, test.b, test.a);

You can just do:
    mr::color test;
    mr_info(test);  // note the new mr_info() macro

You can also print out the whole state, by just doing:
    mr_info(state);

And use C++ streams, like:
    mr_info("This is a test of printing " << 1 << " color " << Cl);

To turn tags into strings, a simple iostream manipulator is provided:
   mr_info("My material is " << tag2name(state->material));

Note that tag2name will only work on the master cpu which has the full
scene database, and only if your program actually spits out object names.
For example, for speed's sake, maya2mr, during previews, does not spit 
out names.


Math
----

Besides that, the mr::math class is a wrapper for platform
independent math operations (cos, etc.) and for overloaded precision.
This class is largely based on ILM's IMath.

Its use is like:
    math<float>::cos( number );


FastMath
--------
Also, the mr::fastmath class provides some additional operators that
trade precision for speed.
Parts of mrClasses take advantage of these speed ups when possible.
You probably should, too.


Derivs
------
The mrDerivs.h provides common and easy to use routines for 
calculating common derivatives.  dPdu, dPds, dNds, Du(), Dv(), du, dv,
etc.
See the shader gg_showinfo.cpp for examples of its use.


Memory
------
As part of including mrClasses, the global new/delete operators are
also overloaded, so that they call the mray's allocation functions.
The mrMemory.h class also allows tracking memory leaks and usage by
setting up the macro MR_MEM_CHECK.
Be careful if you mix shaders with and without MR_MEM_CHECK, as you
don't want to be doing new() with one set of calls and delete() with
another.  Ideally, place your MR_MEM_CHECK shader first in the list
of shaders loaded.


Rman
----
Finally, for those used to renderman's shading language, the mrRman.h
file provide an additional namespace called rsl which contains most of
the functions of the RSL shading language, using an almost identical 
syntax whenever possible.  
Note, however, that string options are usually changed for enums instead.
  
These functions make it very practical to translate renderman shaders
almost by doing cut/paste, but manual optimization and following mray
conventions instead can still shell out better performance.

The file mrRman_macros.h contains macros to easily map the structs within
state to the prman equivalents.  So P will refer to state->point, N to
state->normal, etc.   

Note that objects within miState do NOT support the features of mr::vector
and similar.


Usage in a shader, goes something like:

#include "mrGenerics.h"
using namespace mr;


To use renderman functionality, use:

#include "mrGenerics.h"
#include "mrRman.h"
#include "mrRman_macros.h"  // so P is state->point, etc.

using namespace mr;
using namespace rsl;


Perlin
------
This is an implementation of Improved Perlin noise.  That is, perlin noise
without problems at lattice points.
Versions are provided for signed noise (snoise [-1,1]), noise [0,1], and
periodic functions of them.  


Worley
------
A very standard worley noise implementation.


Cell
----
A standard cellnoise implememtation, that does not suffer from some of the
issues in other public domain code.


Sampler
-------
A renderman11 kind-of wrapper, but smarter, for mi_sample().
Example:

 hemisphereSampler g( state->normal, 16 );

 color result( kNoInit );
 color CKd;

 while ( g.cosine() )
 {
     if ( mi_trace_reflection( result, state, &g.direction() ) )
     {
         CKd += result;
     }
 }

 CKd /= g.count();

Note that this class does make mi_sample() loops a very tiny bit
slower, as the g.cosine() or g.uniform() constructs cannot usually
be optimized by the compiler.

Mutex
-----
Don't you hate mi_locks, having to init them, release them, etc?
mr::mutex will do that for you automatically.  Just do:

	  static mr::mutex myLock;

	  routine()
	  {
		myLock.lock();
		// sensitive code
		myLock.unlock();
	  }

The lock will be inited automatically on creation and removed on
deletion.  Note that maya2mr, on windows, at least, is very, very bad
about this and during loading of the .dll (when mutex is instantiated,
mi_init_lock will NOT work properly and will make the dll not load).
To work around the problem, you should not use static mr::mutex'es but
use pointers to them which would be inited in one of the mray multiple
_init (shader_init or module_init) routines.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

For more documentation, consult the source code.
You can also run doxygen (an automatic documentation system) on mrClasses 
to get a better perspective and html docs.


Command-Line options
--------------------

When compiling your shaders, you can define some macros to change the
behavior of the compilation.

MR_MEM_CHECK
This will re-define the global new and delete operators to allow for memory
debugging.  This will catch all memory leaks using such operators and it 
may also help to catch memory trashing.
Note that mi_mem_allocate and malloc are NOT checked for correctness.

MR_DEBUG
This will turn on all assertions in the mrClasses.  By default, for speed
reasons, the mrClasses do very little self checking of its functions and 
of the parameters passed to them.
When strange behavior occurs, this can sometimes help pinpoint problems.  
This will also help catch NaNs, stopping the code right after a nan 
assignment occurs.

MR_SSE
This is to enable SSE optimizations when possible.  SSE is originally
an Intel optimization that works with Pentium3 or later cpus.  Latest AMD
processors (Athlon64, AthlonXP) also support SSE optimizations.
The default in the project is to have SSE optimizations on.
SSE optimization can give anywhere from 25% to 300% speedup in some
operations.  Currently, this is mostly used for matrix operations.
