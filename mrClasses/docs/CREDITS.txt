However, it would not have been possible without the contribution 
(whether known or unknown) of other researchers, TDs and 
other open source and non-open source developers.


Thanks go to (in no particular order):

mental images
Rolf Herken, Thomas Driemeyer and others
For pushing raytracing even at times when it was considered 
too slow to be used in production.
For developing what is likely to become the standard ideas and
concepts of today and future raytracers and their APIs.

TDI
For having more or less developed the ideas of shading trees and 
IPR as artists know them today.

Pixar - http://www.pixar.com
For having created the RISpec and for on occasion teaching CG to others.
The RenderMan (R) Interface Procedures and Protocol are:

Also for supporting libtiff and adding their texture code to it.

The Affine Toolkit - http://www.affine.org/
copyright (c) 1995-1998 Thomas Burge
For providing some implementations of common renderman routines
and other useful functions.

Magic Software -  http://www.magic-software.org/
David Eberly's website is one of legend already within the 3D
community.  Providing math tutorials, and working source code
for a huge variety of problems, together with two 3d books.

Industrial Light and Magic - http://www.ilm.com
Florian Kainz and others, who contributed to OpenEXR and more
importantly, to releasing the Imath library for free, which
shares some concepts with mrClasses.

Sam Leffler, Frank Warmerdam, Andrey Kiselev, Mike Welles and Dwight Kelly.
For libtiff, making TIFF reading as painless as possible.

Softimage
Dave Lajoie and others
For being the first 3d company to open source their
shader library.  A whole generation of shader writers likely
learnt from it.

Matt Pharr
For being a great teacher both at Stanford and online.  For also
sharing his knowledge (and often, his own code) freely and without 
any obscure academic explanations.

Miguel Garcao for being the first brave soul to provide his own shaders
as examples of mrClasses' usage.

Nvidia for the idea of the swizzle operators.

Ken Perlin for his noise functions (both old and new).
Improved Perlin is based on Perlin's own Java code, adapted thru ideas
described by Hugo Elias and others.

Steve Worley for the noise that bears his name.
And for being an inspiration to all shader writers, too.

Jim Blinn.  What would we do without you?  30+ years doing CG and
still as fresh as a young student.

Okan Arikan for Pixie and for making it open source.

Graphic Gems and Game Gems editors and contributors.

Foley and Van Damm for obvious reasons.

Paul Heckbert, for his thesis.

Michael McCool and his team for the ideas pioneered in Sh.  mrClasses
will probably end up borrowing stuff from it.
