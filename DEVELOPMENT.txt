The enclosed files include mrClasses and mrLiquid as far as they were developed.
The testing of these files was done with maya8.0 up to maya2008.
To adapt it to newer mayas, mrShaderLightAttrs has to be updated to reflect the
indices of the light attributes and the grammar.y and fileobjgrammar.y and 
grammar.lex need to be updated.
The raylib version of mrLiquid was never tested.  Most likely it needs to fix
the initialization and the update of the IPR.
