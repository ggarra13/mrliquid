This is a list of contributors, detailing their contribution:

Imre Tuske 
Both provided really the motivation for me to get off my butt and do this.

Martin Leguizamón
Provided some changes for compatability with MSVC6 and the Intel Compiler.
The amount of work he did for trying, debugging and finding bugs in the 
converter was staggering. 

Andrew Chapman
Provided the idea of render passes done thru overrides thru his own
free plugin and gently offered the use of his MEL code for whatever I
wanted.  
Code now being used in mental shares a lot of similarities to Andrew's.
Albeit giving credit where it is due, the override idea was
also something present in XSI at the time, so perhaps the original idea
should be credited to someone there, too.

Pavel Ledin
Provided some useful bug reports for debugging some silly bugs.
