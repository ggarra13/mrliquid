	
mrLiquid
--------

My main goal while developing mrLiquid is to allow artists everywhere to
take advantage of the best converter and render engine, while at the same time
make enough money so that it justifies my effort in supporting it.
Albeit I might give my time away for free to develop it, truth is that
both Alias and mental ray cost money.

As such, I've decided to split mrLiquid into several versions.
While the actual version number may differ with time, the main idea is to
keep 2 or 3 versions of the software.  Such that:

     * one version is commercial   (this version has all the bells and
				    whistles, but you pay for it)

     * one version is free         (this version is probably 1-2 years
				    behind the commercial version and is
				    only available an older maya release)

     * one version is open source  (this version is probably 2 or 3 years
				    behind the commercial version - source
				    code is there, but you get 0 support 
				    from me)


Currently, the available mrLiquid versions are:
    * Open Source Version:  v0.6
    * Free Version:	    v0.7
    * Commercial Version:   v0.8

In addition, the commercial version is being split into different
licensing schemes.

								 COST (u$s)
							       --------------
    - mrLiquid open source support per incident		            500
    - mrLiquid open source yearly support			  5,000
    - mrLiquid open source - custom development			 TBD per req.
    - mrLiquid through .mi files				 500 per lic.
    - Source Code (without raylib)				 75,000
    - Source Code (without raylib) + 1 year support/devel.	100,000
    - Source Code (with raylib source code)			100,000
    - Source Code (with raylib source code) + 1 year support	125,000


In addition to the open source version of mrLiquid, a newer version of 
mrLiquid (sans source code) is available for download.

Description:
   mrLiquid through .mi files:
	This is very similar to the free version available, but with less
	bugs, faster conversion and added features.

   mrLiquid as a geometry shader: (TBA)
	This version allows you to use mrLiquid's core to spit .mi files
	as well as run the mrLiquid engine within Mayatomr through a
	geometry shader.  This allows you to IPR things that are not
	currently possible in Mayatomr without the need to buy the
	mental ray stand-alone.

All source code licensing gives you the right to use the code for your
own in-house applications, learning and so forth.  It does not give you
copyright over it and it does not allow you to sell it commercially.

   Source Code (without raylib)
	This option gives you access to the latest version of mrLiquid's
	source code.  You can deploy it on as many machines or platforms
	as you wish.  You cannot, however, embed mrLiquid within a 
	geometry shader or link it against mental images' raylib/mental 
	matter/mental mesh/etc. libraries.

   Source Code (without raylib) + 1 year support
	As above, but you also get me for a year to help you out
	remotely and to add custom code particular to your facility.

   Source Code (with raylib source code)
	This option gives you access to the latest version of mrLiquid's
	source code.  You can deploy it on as many machines or platforms
	as you wish.  You can use this version to embed mrLiquid in
	a geometry shader (and use it with Mayatomr) or link it against
	any of mental images' libraries.
	What this does NOT give you is Copyright rights.  I retain them
	so as to allow me to do other similar sales.

   Source Code (with raylib source code) + support
	As above, but you also get me for a year to help you out
	remotely and to add custom code particular to your facility.


Benefits of the Commercial Version:
   - Linux / OSX / Windows.
   - Full PDF docs.
   - Can run stand-alone without Mayatomr (tiny memory footprint).
   - Tons of bugs removed.
   - Two-Pass IPR, for super fast progressive IPR.
   - Control on Progressive IPRs sampling.
   - Triangle meshes are supported for smaller memory footprint.
   - Supports all new mray3.5 options (new finalgather modes,
     catmull-clark meshes, instance light linking, spectrum 
     colorprofiles).
   - Subdivision surfaces support different uv interpolations (no
     stretching).
   - Shadow maps can be shown and previewed easily, even in IPR.
   - Automatic Phenomena creation and expansion with easy to use
     AETemplates.
     Easily create a library of shaders with a single mouse click.
     On complex scenes with many shaders, collapsing shading networks
     into phenomena keeps maya scene small for faster loading.
   - Full PaintFX support.
     Almost all meshes and lines are supported with proper texturing.
   - Trace groups.  Selectively choose which objects refract/reflect
     onto others.
   - Particle Instancer works in IPR.
   - Sprite particles are now fully supported, with texturing.
   - Easy to use arbitrary output passes/buffers.
   - Support for samples pass rendering/compositing.
   - High Quality Image Viewer.
     A full replacement for imf_disp and maya's RenderView, it can
     display your renders in full HDR float precision.
     Supports all mental ray formats, stubs, AVIs, Quicktimes, etc.
   - Updated RubyMEL with Full Bindings to the Maya API.
     Write plugins in ruby for fast prototyping.
   - Faster conversion.
   - Maya 7 or 8.
