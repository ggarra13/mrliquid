Compared to maya2mr, these are the main things that are currently 
not supported (yet):

1)  ** DONE **
2)  ** DONE **
3)  ** DONE **
4)  ** DONE **
5)  **DONE**
6)  **DONE**  
7)  **DONE**
8)  **DONE**
9)  **DONE**
10) **DONE**
11) **DONE**

The main reason for the above stuff missing is twofold:
a) I had no time to do it all just yet :)
b) Some of those will require changing completely how that stuff works 
   in maya2mr as the maya2mr/Alias implementation of all of the above is, 
   imo, not that great.
   I need to think on it for a while before I jump to code it in...
