BUGS
----

- unload of mayatomr in 2008 crashes.  (Linux)
- Unknown maya format "imagefile".  Using iff instead.  (Linux)  **FIXED?**
- Creation of subd sphere/cube in windows does not subdivide. (Windows)

- Bad topology for cylinder subd. (Fixed?)
- mi_int_mem_allocate missing (Windows upon loading)


INSTALLER
---------


- Add  ruby1.8 to path?
- Test RNDR.rb and similar are working properly.










---------------------------------------------------------
Ideally, this file would be empty :)


// Error: createRenderNodeLoadPluginCallback mrLiquid-demo; // 
// Error: Line 1.49: Wrong number of arguments on call to createRenderNodeLoadPluginCallback. // 


Known things not working:

- Cropping tool is not 100% accurate under some camera Fit options.

- You can animate the showing/hiding of objects if doing
   incremental saving of .mi files (ie. several frames into a 
   single .mi file), but the objects need to be visible in the first frame
   or you need to spit all objects (non-invisible ones too).
   Workaround: either spit all non-visible objects or 
	       spit frames into separate .mi files.

- If using multiple renderers in the same scene, there is the potential
   for conflict.  Some renderers add their own set of attributes to the 
   light nodes and shaders. 
   **SOMEWHAT FIXED**

- Particle instancer currently does not match maya's cycles completely.

- Particles do not match exactly as maya2mr.  **FIXED, CLOSE ENOUGH**

- Tube Particles are not supported yet.

- Particles Numeric and Particles Spheres are not supported.

- Particles Cycle Objects do not match maya, unless an expression is used.

- Changing resolution to a bigger resolution than the one we started with
  crashes imf_disp.  (mray imf_disp bug) **FIXED WITH MRVIEWER**

- mentalStopImrRender.mel is deactivated, as it was causing problems.  Maya
  seems to call it a bunch of times once you open the render view window.
  Investigate...



   mrLIQUID BUGS/Stuff to improve:
   - Fix cloud shader, so it is volumetric and intersecting plane 
     does not show spheres.
   - Improve speed of motionblur octree by making moblur path 
      intersection accurate, instead of bounding sphere.
   - Whole octree intersector is pathetically slow compared to 
     maya2mr. Improve.
   - Add tube particle.
   - Creating nurbs curves should not do a re-render.
     We still need to have callbacks for them in case they are linked
     to weird expressions and so forth.
   - Baking -- create them thru render passes.
   - Bake Geometry options window should allow you to also select
     how nodes are spit (short paths or long paths) and how to
     deal with namespaces.

   mrLiquid stuff to add:
   - Rendering of curves


   MAYA BUGS:
   - API is not callback safe.  Running, say, MFnMesh on a mesh that
     has just been created and that does not have its inMesh attribute
     yet connected will crash maya.
   - Also, a lot of weird behavior can be seen when API is called 
     during callbacks of object creation/connection (Nurbs Surfaces 
     returning degree 0, opengl icons going berserk, etc...).
     If not a bug but a feature, documentation needs clarification
     when and what api functions can be called where.
   - Tear-off menu will crash maya if their contents are deleted
     or even if the parent menu is deleted [this bug is only
     partially documented in the mel docs].

   MAYA API FEATURES:
   - MLightLink is crap as it flattens list of objects.  Should allow
     easy retrieval of non-flattened lists.  **FIXED WITH MY OWN CODE**


   MRAY BUGS:
   - Neither state shaders nor lens shaders have a way of
     distinguishing when a shadow map is being generated for saving.
     This does not allow me to interrupt the IPR while the shadowmap
     is being generated.  All this needs fixing on mental's side.
   - imf_disp crashes on changing resolution through incremental
     updates.  Very low priority bug.  Most decent houses have
     their own viewer and won't use imf_disp.
   - File objects are not dealing with namespaces properly.
     If I have a file object defined as:

namespace "A"
  object "B"
    file "some.mi"
  end object
end namespace

      the name of the object file searched in the mi file should
      *NOT* be A::B, but just B.  That just kills the whole
      purpose of namespaces.  Also, see below about file objects
      not being object name dependant.

      If, on the other hand, I define my object as:
  object "A::B"
    file "some.mi"
  end object
      then, sure, go search for "A::B" in the mi file.



   MRAY REQUESTS:
   - shadow map caching to files in mray saves out the 
     whole map and re-does the shadow map generation, thou.
     We are still behind on this... shadow map caching needs to
     happen in tiles as rendering progresses. 
   - File objects need recursion, but no news there.
   - File objects need to not be name dependant.  It should be
     possible to specify a "name" parameter for the file object
     to look for that object name in the .mi file.
     The reason is that to do crowds, you actually want to
     duplicate file objects and have them be offsetted in time, not
     just instantiate them (ie. object A, reads "test.10.mi", while 
     object B, reads "test.50.mi" --- but they both reference the
     same pre-baked guy in Troy, but at different frames of the
     walk cycle).  
     With the current file object design where the name of the
     object is the one used to search for in the mi file, I can't
     do that without having to keep identical mi files with only
     the names changed.  
     Proper namespaces would at least allow me a very ugly 
     work-around, but a naming paramater is the stuff really needed,
     as this would allow file objects to be easily duplicated while
     in IPR, too.
   - Saving/Loading of samples needs to be available to shader
     writers in other shaders other than sample compositing shaders.
     


   MAYATOMR BUGS:
   - hair shadows are wrong, shadow shader not attached, hair shader
     not returning transparency.
