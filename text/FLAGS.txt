Attributes not converted or paid attention by mrLiquid:

- miDisplaceAnimation  -- needed? Don't think is needed with my architecture
- miAnimation          -- hmm... is it really that expensive?
- miDerivatives        -- do we really need it?  After all, it should be up
			  to the shader to ask for derivatives functionality
- nodeCycleCheck       -- mrLiquid checks for cycles automatically.  It is
			  not that expensive (I think).
